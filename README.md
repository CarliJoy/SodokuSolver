# Sudoku Solver

A fastly written Sudoku Solver written together with my flatmate in our first try of 
"[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)".

I started as a bet with our girlfriends that we are able to write a solver faster as 
they could finish to hard Sudokus manually.
We took 2.5 for the working prototype, and the bet is not yet decided as they didn't
start their Sudokus yet. 

Let's see :-)

Later I looked and found that others take 
[less than 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM) 
to write even simpler code, but hey - we didn't study computer science ;-).
