# Sudoku Solver
A fastly written Sudoku Solver written together with my flatmate in our first try of 
"[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)".

## Usage
This tool requires Python 3.

Create a Sudoku with Excel using the Template `ImportTemplate.xltx`

Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, best in a 
virtual environment and then simply run:

```
python3 solver.py Example.xlsx
```

and the result will be prompted and also written to a new Excel file.

## About
I started as a bet with our girlfriends that we are able to write a solver faster as 
they could finish to hard Sudokus manually.
We took 2.5 for the working prototype, and the bet is not yet decided as they didn't
start their Sudokus yet. 

Let's see :-)

Later I looked and found that others take 
[less than 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM) 
to write even simpler code, but hey - we didn't study computer science ;-).
